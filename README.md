# 🍎 PRODIGY ML TASK 5: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation 🥗

**🎯 Task:** Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

**💾 Dataset:** [Kaggle Food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101)

**🍕 Project Overview**

This repository contains code for a deep learning model designed for **Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation**. The model takes an image of food as input and performs two key tasks:

1.  **Food Recognition:** Identifies the specific type of food present in the image (e.g., pizza, apple, salad). 🍔
2.  **Calorie Estimation:** Estimates the calorie content of the recognized food item, providing nutritional information to the user. 🥑

This tool aims to help users track their dietary intake, make informed food choices, and manage their nutrition effectively.

The model leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image recognition and potentially a regression model or a knowledge base linking food items to their calorie content for the estimation part.

**✨ Key Features:**

* **Food Recognition:** Identifies various food items from images using deep learning techniques. 🥕
* **Calorie Estimation:** Estimates the calorie content of the recognized food to provide nutritional information. 🍎
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple interface (potentially a web application) for users to upload images and receive food recognition results and estimated calorie counts. 📱
* **Extensibility:** Easily extendable to recognize additional food categories with more training data. ➕
* **Accuracy:** Aims for high accuracy in both food recognition and calorie estimation for common food items. 👍

**⚙️ Installation Prerequisites:**

Make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:

* **Python:** Version >= 3.6 🐍
* **TensorFlow:** Version >= 2.0 (for building and training the CNN) 🧠
* **OpenCV:** Version >= 2.0 (for image handling) 👀
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations 🔢
* **Flask (Optional):** For creating a web application interface (if implemented) 🌐
* **GPU Support (Recommended):** For faster training of the deep learning model 🚀

You can install the core libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
# If creating a web app:
pip install Flask
